# Overview
pgClusterMonitor is a service that controls a cluster of PostgreSQL DB with WAL streaming replication. The service considers the following cases:
- Performs auto-failover command for the standby DB node.
- Restores master DB as a standby DB in the case of two or more master DB nodes in the cluster.
- Directs replication of all standby DB nodes to a single master DB node.
- Controls synchronous_standby_names attribute of master DB node depends on standby nodes availability.

# Requirements
- pgClusterMonitor supports PostgreSQL version 12.
- Python 3.6.
- DB user mentioned in connectionstring for the local DB must be superuser to work with `ALTER SYSTEM ...` commands.

# How to use
- It is supposed that an instance of pgClusterMonitor should be deployed on each DB server. The following steps should be performed on each DB server.
- Install PostgreSQL 12 on each server in the cluster and set up WAL streaming replication. You can also use script for deploying PostgreSQL DB cluster from the [docker_postgresql_wal_replication](https://github.com/treshnikov/docker_postgresql_wal_replication) repository. The default configuration in `config.ini` is aimed at the Docker container `p1` from mentioned repository.
- Install Python version 3.6 or higher.
- Run the following command to install packages `pip install flake8 psycopg2 urllib3 coloredlogs pywin32 servicemanager`.
- Define settings in the `config.ini` file (see the chapter below).  
- Navigate to `pg_cluster_monitor` directory and run `python main.py`.
## Windows
- You can also install and run the service as a Windows Service. For this navigate to `pg_cluster_monitor` directory and run `python windows_service.py install --startup=auto` and then start the service `python windows_service.py start`. 
- In case of failure while starting the service check the following file in Python directory `Lib\site-packages\win32\pywintypes38.dll`. 
## Linux
To run the service as a Linux Service follow these steps:
- Create a file for the service: `sudo touch /lib/systemd/system/pg-cluster-monitor.service`.
- Edit `pg-cluster-monitor.service` file like this:
  ```ini
  [Unit]
  Description=PostgreSQL Cluster Monitor Service
  After=multi-user.target

  [Service]
  WorkingDirectory=/pg_cluster_monitor
  User=root
  Type=idle
  ExecStart=/usr/bin/python3 /pg_cluster_monitor/main.py
  Restart=always

  [Install]
  WantedBy=multi-user.target
  ```
where `/pg_cluster_monitor` is the directory with the source code. 
- Then run the following commands:
  ```sh
  sudo systemctl daemon-reload
  sudo systemctl enable pg-cluster-monitor.service
  sudo systemctl start pg-cluster-monitor.service
  ```
- Check the service status with `systemctl status pg-cluster-monitor.service` command.
- If you debug the service on a PostgreSQL cluster deployed on your computer in Docker containers - add to `host`-file aliases for Docker containers (for instance, `127.0.0.1 p1 and 127.0.0.1 p2`) in order to let the service work with the `primary_conninfo` correctly. The service compares `primary_conninfo` and connection string to master DB, so both parameters should point to the same host. For more details see `StandbyDbHandler.checkFollowingMaster()` at `standbyDbHandler.py`.   

# Description of the main algorithm
- Check the PostgreSQL server state. If the server is not running - run and wait for the server.
- For each DB in the cluster gather and log the following information:
    - Host
    - Connection status
    - Timestamp of last successful connection
    - DB time
    - DB size
    - DB role - MASTER or STANDBY
    - Replication position for STANDBY node
    - Synchronous_standby_names attribute
    - Size of pg_wal directory
    - Number of pg_wal directory files
    - Primary_conninfo attribute
    - Primary_slot_name attribute
    - Number of slots
- Log alerts if:
    - There is no standbys.
    - There is no master.
    - There is more than one master.
- If the local node is MASTER:
    - Select synchronous_standby_names parameter and perform "ALTER SYSTEM SET synchronous_standby_names TO '*'" or "...TO ''" depends on standby nodes availability.
    - If there is another master in the cluster
        - Select the master with the biggest DB.
        - If the local DB is not the biggest one - downgrade it after defined timeout and start following a new master. For downgrade first try to use pg_rewind and only then pg_basebackup in case of failure.
- If the local node is STANDBY:
    - Check the local network adapter and continue only if the connection is established.
    - If there is no master in the cluster:
        - Check time without master and consider promotion if defined timeout has exceeded.
            - Do promotion if the current standby is single standby in the cluster.
            - Do promotion if the current standby has the highest replication position than others standby nodes.
            - If there are two or more standby servers with the same replication position - select the first one. If local standby is not the first - skip promotion.
    - If there is only one master in the cluster:
        - Check that the current standby follows the single master.
        - If the standby followed another master - start following the single master.
    - If there is more than one master:
        - Do nothing, wait until there will be exactly one master.
